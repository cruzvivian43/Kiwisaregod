	<h1>About me</h1>
 
	<h1>Something</h1>
      <p>My name is Vivian Cruz. My hobbies are reading, in which you 
will see a book in my hands most of the time. 
I do like to cook time to time, if I feel like it.
I attend the High School for Language and Diplomacy. I have a very diverse group of friends and
I very much enjoy their company.
